/**
 * An immutable [ByteArray] wrapper with structural equality.
 *
 * The [equals] and [hashCode] implementations for [ByteArray] are instance-based, not
 * content-based, meaning that two [ByteArray]s with the same contents are not considered equal.
 * This behavior is often undesirable because it is unexpected and requires developers to maintain
 * their own [equals] and [hashCode] implementations for data classes with [ByteArray] fields.
 *
 * This class is usable in place of [ByteArray] where structural equality is desired, such as in
 * data classes.
 *
 * [ByteArray]s are also normally mutable. This class performs defensive copies on construction and
 * [copyToByteArray] conversion to prevent internal mutation.

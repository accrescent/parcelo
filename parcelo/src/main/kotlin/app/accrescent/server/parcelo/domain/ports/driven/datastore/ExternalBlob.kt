/**
 * A reference to a blob on an external blob storage system.
 *
 * A blob is in one of three states: pending, committed, and deleted. Pending blobs may or may not
 * exist in the blob storage system at their location; they represent blobs which are awaiting
 * upload. Committed blobs are guaranteed to be available in blob storage. Deleted blobs, like
 * pending blobs, may or may not exist in blob storage; they represent blobs which are irreversibly
 * marked as deleted to be later removed from blob storage. Once a blob is marked as deleted, its
 * status must never change back to committed since the referenced blob might be removed by a
 * cleanup process.
 *
 * @param S the type of the blob's [status].
 * @property id the unique identifier of this blob reference.
 * @property createTime the time at which the blob reference was created.
 * @property bucketName the name of the bucket the blob is contained in.
 * @property objectKey the name of the blob within its bucket.
 * @property status the current state of the blob.
